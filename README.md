Years ago, I attended some lectures for the learning the index of stock, such as RSI, moving average, and MACD. From the lectures, it seemed that people can use these index to find out the timing to buy stocks and sell the stock, which might help investors earn money easily from stock market. However, when I was physically into the market, the information of index did not work very well and the rate of return did not reach my goal in a long run. This experience encourage me to use data mining methods to analysis the stock data, to make sure the information that the index convey matches the knowledge I learned in the lecture, and to know that if it is reasonable to predict the future tendency based on the information of index.
